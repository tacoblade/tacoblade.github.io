# Hello there,

I'm Thomas!

This site collects my projects, notes, and writing as I grow. It's actually quite daunting to put myself out there in this way, sharing my thoughts to the internet and making myself vulnerable to strangers' judgement of my curated readings, my opinions on the things I care about, the projects I've worked on... but it's also an opportunity to learn and grow, and reflect on my progress as I engage enthusiastically with the struggles of life.

I'm a:
- foodie
- dog dad (father to Bonothan Bean Boothang, 5 y/o frenchton)
- software engineer
- gamer
- writer
- lebron lover

I'm Korean-Canadian living in the US.

I try really hard to be curious!

I love meeting new people and making new friends!

I enjoy cooking (I have a bias for carb-y dishes that will knock me out)

I'm really glad you're here reading this, because it's a chance to connect – I'd love to hear from you. 

- **Writing:** short notes and longer posts
**Journeys** adventure logs – from travels far and wide to local trips to new restaurants
- **Resume:** background and contact
